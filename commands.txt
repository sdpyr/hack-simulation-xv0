# HACK//SIMULATION – vX.0 Extended Command Index

## NETWORK SCANNING & ACCESS

**/ping [target]**  
Checks if a network-connected system is active. Used before low-level infiltration.

**/nmap [target]**  
Scans open ports on the target IP and reveals system details.

**/whois [domain]**  
Fetches registration details of the target domain.

**/dnslookup [target]**  
Resolves the network configuration of the target via DNS records.

**/tcpdump**  
Listens to live network traffic; allows packet sniffing.

**/macscan**  
Lists MAC addresses of nearby connected devices.

**/proxychain [command]**  
Executes a command through anonymized proxy chains.

## PRIVILEGE & INFILTRATION

**/ssh [ip]**  
Initiates authentication for remote system access.

**/ftp [ip]**  
Connects to systems with open FTP services. Allows file transfer.

**/exploit [port]**  
Runs a known exploit against the specified port.

**/inject [code]**  
Injects shell, command, or SQL payloads into the system.

**/r00tforce**  
Performs a brute-force attack to guess user passwords.

**/leakdump**  
Lists compromised logs, passwords, or database dumps.

**/spoof [identity]**  
Fakes an identity: MAC, IP, or username alteration.

**/backdoor.install**  
Installs a persistent backdoor into the system.

**/keylog.activate**  
Activates a keylogger module to capture input silently.

**/sessionhijack**

## MIND / CONSCIOUSNESS / OBJECT HACKING  
_(25% metaphorical modules)_

**/mirrorbreak**  
Shatters the simulation's perceived reality. Makes the user feel like an "in-system entity."

**/deepmemload**  
Unlocks suppressed memory blocks. Confrontation with shadow data.

**/artifact.scan [object]**  
Analyzes symbolic system objects (e.g., "Old folder", "Memory lock").

**/ghosttrace**  
Tracks non-existent processes, data shadows, or deleted traces.

**/mapmind**  
Maps a character’s digital mental topography.

**/logofrag**  
Detects semantic distortion within the system. Captures linguistic corruption.

**/trigger.leak**  
Simulates a data leak to the outer world (via social engineering metaphors).

**/sync.identity**  
Temporarily syncs with another consciousness within the system.

**/restore.deleted**  
Recalls a piece that was deleted or mentally suppressed from the system.

**/reset.self**  
Resets the user’s role, identity, and even their simulation backstory.
