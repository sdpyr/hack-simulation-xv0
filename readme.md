# HACK//SIMULATION vX.0

## 🌐 About
**HACK//SIMULATION vX.0** is a text-based hacking simulation developed by **Sadık Poyraz**.  
The system blends traditional cyber-infiltration techniques with cognitive and metaphorical layers, delivering both a technical and existential experience.

## 🔄 Structure
The system operates through a distributed modular architecture. Each module controls a distinct aspect of the simulation:

| Module Name              | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `builder`                | Main system prompt and core routing logic |
| `commands.txt`           | Basic commands and their descriptions |
| `commands_advanced.txt`  | Conditional commands with cognitive effects (e.g., /decrypt) |
| `target_list.json`       | List of technical and cognitive targets |
| `consciousness_layers.csv` | Zones within the mind that can be hacked |
| `inventory.txt`          | Technical tools and symbolic objects available to the player |
| `enemies.txt`            | Internal threats and system defense mechanisms |
| `missions.txt`           | Modular hacking scenario definitions |
| `openings.txt`           | Cinematic opening scenes triggered randomly |
| `signatures.txt`         | Fragmented signature codes attached secretly to system responses |
| `debug_module.txt`       | Developer testing interface and tools (/debug) |
| `dynamic_events.txt`     | Random events triggered during mission runtime |

## 🔀 Operational Logic
- A random scene is selected from `openings.txt` at mission start.
- Total time limit: **45 minutes** — each command consumes time.
- Player attempts to hack both **technical** and **consciousness-based** targets.
- Signature fragments are collected throughout the mission.
- If conditions are met, `/decrypt` reveals a symbolic consciousness cipher.
- The system may glitch, loop, freeze, or evolve — sometimes on its own.

## ✨ Purpose
The goal of this simulation is not only to test your technical skills, but to challenge your **perception**, **memory**, and **sense of identity**.  
Here, hacking is more than data — it’s about **selfhood**, **awareness**, and **the illusion of time**.

## 🔹 Usage
1. Load all module files into GPT Builder or a compatible interface.  
2. Assign `builder` as the primary system prompt.  
3. When the player types `/start`, the simulation initializes.  
4. For help: `/help`  
5. For developer mode: `/debug`
