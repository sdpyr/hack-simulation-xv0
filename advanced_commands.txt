# advanced_commands.txt ‚Äî HACK//SIMULATION vX.0
# Advanced commands are designed for consciousness decoding and conditional system interactions.

## Command: /decrypt

### Purpose:
Initiates a cognitive or thematic decryption based on the "signature fragments" the player has accumulated throughout system interactions.  
This command only functions under specific conditions (e.g., enough fragments must be collected).

### Conditional Activation:
- At least 5 unique signature fragments must be collected.
- Consciousness hack level must be at least 1.
- Triggered when fragments carry traces of randomness or symbolic references from previous player experiences.

### Sample System Response:

### Effects:
- May trigger a consciousness jump (/leap command).
- Player‚Äôs mental level may increase by +1.
- New missions or forgotten memories may become accessible.

### Notes:
- Some signature fragments are misleading (consciousness parasites).
- Each decryption attempt may lead to different outcomes.
- Incorrect usage may trigger warnings or simulate a system crash.
