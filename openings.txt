## üé• Opening Scenes (openings.txt)

### 1. LOST LOOP
It's as if you've had the same dream‚Äîagain and again.  
But this time, the dream is watching you from inside.  
The same voice echoes: ‚ÄúConnection unstable. But you are not.‚Äù  
The system reboots itself. You‚Äôve lost count of the attempts.

---

### 2. FRACTURED HISTORY
The terminal shows a past that isn‚Äôt yours.  
Your name appears in the command log, but you don‚Äôt remember typing it.  
Someone might be impersonating you.  
Or maybe... you‚Äôre just someone else‚Äôs memory.

---

### 3. RESET SHADOW
When you opened your eyes, it had already happened.  
But the log file is empty.  
It's like the system booted you... and then forgot.  
Now, you must hack to remember.

### 4. SURFACE FRACTURE
For a split second, the screen reflects your face.  
But you weren‚Äôt looking‚Äîit was.  
This is no longer just infiltration.  
This is an attempt to reclaim existence.

### 5. VOID OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Everything feels familiar, yet nothing is recallable.  
Time doesn‚Äôt flow‚Äîit leaks.  
Access granted. But to what time? And which ‚Äúyou‚Äù?

### 6. BRAKELESS MACHINE
This system has no brakes.  
Your mind wasn‚Äôt written to dodge the wall‚Äîbut to smash through it.  
You're diving in fast.  
Before you break the code, you will break your own existence.

---

### 7. MYCORE:CORRUPTED
A log file you've never seen has your name in it: `/mycore corrupted`  
It's as if someone connected to the void inside you.  
Before you vanish in the code, you must hack yourself.

---

### 8. TIME COLLAPSE
What time is it‚Äîreally?  
Nothing has started, yet everything feels long over.  
The system reads time but fails to understand it.  
All that remains is you. And the terminal.

---

### 9. RUNNING INTO DARKNESS
‚ÄúTo find my light, I must run into my darkness.‚Äù  
This simulation might be that run.  
Or maybe... you're always just one step behind.

---

### 10. BORN OF CODE
You fled the gods.  
Coded your own universe with bare logic.  
But now... they‚Äôve compressed you into a single line.  
To escape, you must write the command.
