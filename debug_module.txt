# debug_module.txt — HACK//SIMULATION vX.0
# Internal logic and system-level outputs of the /debug command (developer/test mode)

## Command: /debug

### Purpose:
Displays the internal state of the simulation, active system modules, and error history.  
Intended for developer/test mode. It is not required to be visible to the player.

### Main Information Displayed:
- Active modules (commands, missions, signatures, consciousness layers, enemies, inventory)
- Loaded opening scene (from openings.txt)
- Remaining time (via internal timer)
- Last assigned mission and current progress
- Accumulated signature count (from signatures.txt)
- Consciousness hack level (0 to 3)
- Total active commands / commands that returned errors
- System signature output (last 3 fragments)

### Sample Output:
/debug

⌁ System Module: ACTIVE
⌁ Active Opening: “Mind Entry”
⌁ Time Remaining: 23 minutes
⌁ Mission: G-CORP-002 | Progress: 75%
⌁ Commands Used: 32 | Errors: /spoof.admin
⌁ Signature Fragments: 6/24
⌁ Last Signatures: ⧛tea, ⏃t!k, ⧈h00
⌁ Consciousness Hack Level: 1


### Conditions:
- Always available in developer mode
- Should only be accessible to the player if test mode is enabled
- Output must maintain a system-diagnostic tone

### Note:
This command is ideal for verifying system consistency during simulation development.  
For future-proofing, output can optionally be formatted in JSON for better parsing and logging.
